# web-desktop-wallpapers

This repository holds wallpaper themes and a small Flask API that provides system metrics to a web-based frontend (for example, Hidamari).

Development notes:

- Create a local virtual environment at `.venv` and install dependencies from `requirements.txt` in the repository root.
- See `docs/` for usage and API details.
